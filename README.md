# Waffle Run
Updated, Modified, and Ported to Windows.
---
Using [UndertaleModTool](https://github.com/krzys-h/UndertaleModTool), I modified the game to automatically unlock all characters, including those that never got added, then I removed UI elements relating to things that either no longer work or are not necessary, and reworked the rest of the UI around it. I then found a runner that actually works for the game on Windows, so it can be played on something other than Android (though a patched .apk is provided.)
### Why?
Waffle Run was a random mobile game that I discovered years ago, and really enjoyed for it's simple gameplay. Some time after, it was de-listed. I want to share this game with people, and figured I'd make it a slightly more enjoyable experience.
